👋 Hi, I’m Anushree. 

----

<p> I am an aspiring data analyst, love working in Tableau and SQL. 🌱 I’m currently learning PowerBI and Excel.<p>

Digital Marketing professional with 3 years of experience across diverse work environments with hands-on knowledge of On-page and Off-page SEO tools & tactics, working knowledge of Google Analytics, SEMRush and Moz.

I am quality focused, a problem solver with a high sense of responsibility and ownership and I believe in bringing significant value to any organization with my skills, mindset, an eye for details and an ability to build trustworthy relationships with clients.

👀 My dream is to travel around the world, contribute to the wildlife welfare, and grow into an individual who can positively influence people.
