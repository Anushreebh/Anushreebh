## 👋 Hi, I’m Anushree. 

<p> Data and Business Analyst professional skilled in Tableau and SQL and PowerBI. I am further upskilling myself in Python and Microsoft Excel.<p>

👩‍💻 As a marketing professional I used to deal with tonnes of data and always think what I am doing with such data. I am just sending reports to management without understanding what is happening with data. 
Here comes the picture of " DATA ANALYTICS ". This is my transition from Marketing Professional to Data Analyst .

Talking about my experience, I have a experience of 3.5 years across diverse work environments with hands-on knowledge of On-page and Off-page SEO tools & tactics, working knowledge of Google Analytics, SEMRush and Moz.
  
In addition to my techncial skills, I am quality focused, a problem solver with a high sense of responsibility and ownership and I believe in bringing significant value to any organization with my skills, mindset, an eye for details and an ability to build trustworthy relationships with clients
  
👀 My favourite part is to talk about my dream which is to travel around the world, contribute to the wildlife welfare, and grow into an individual who can positively influence people.
